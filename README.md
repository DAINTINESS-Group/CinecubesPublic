CineCube
=================================
CineCubes produce "movies" as answers to OLAP queriesThe user submits a query over an underlying star schema. Taking this query as input, the system comes up with a set of queries complementing the information content of the original query, and executes them. Then, the system visualizes the query results and accompanies this presentation with a text commenting on the result highlights. Moreover, via a text-to-speech conversion the system automatically produces audio for the constructed text. Each combination of visualization, text and audio practically constitutes a cube movie, which is wrapped as a PowerPoint presentation and returned to the user.

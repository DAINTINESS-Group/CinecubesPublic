By  obtaining, using and/or  copying this program,  you agree that you

Terms and conditions for the distribution of the program
--------------------------------------------------------

This program may not be sold or incorporated into any product which is
sold without prior permission from the author.

When no charge is  made, this program   may be copied  and distributed
freely, provided that  this  notice  is  copied  and  distributed with
it. Each time you  redistribute the program (or  any work based on the
program),  the recipient  automatically  receives a  license  from the
original licensor  to copy or distribute the  program subject to these

If you wish to incorporate the  program into other free programs whose

distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
license and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not  distribute the  program  at all.   For  example, if a  patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the program by
all those who receive copies directly or  indirectly through you, then
the only way  you could satisfy  both it and  this license would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the program.

2. Mbroli Features
--------------------------------------------------------------
Mbroli is a "phoneme-to-speech" program.
Mbroli can be registred on Windows(tm) 95 / NT 4.0 as the default program
for the .pho files, so the .pho can be played by a double click.
An Mbroli.ini file can be used to force mbroli.exe to load a specific 
database (see 4. Ini File).
Mbroli can be called from other programs, passing one or more .pho to be
played on the command line (see 3. Command Line).
Mbroli supports the Drag & Drop of multiple .pho files.  So, one or more
.pho files can be dropped on the Mbroli Window while the program is running,
or on the Mbroli.exe icon or on a Shortcut of Mbroli.exe.
Mbroli can also play just an excerpt of a .pho file, by selecting the line to
be played the view.

This program and object code is being provided to "you", the licensee,

applies to any  program, object code  or other  work which contains  a
notice   placed by the copyright  holder  saying it may be distributed
under the terms  of this license.  The "program", below, refers to any
such program, object code or work.

By  obtaining, using and/or  copying this program,  you agree that you
have   read, understood,   and   will  comply  with these   terms  and
conditions:

Terms and conditions for the distribution of the program
--------------------------------------------------------

This program may not be sold or incorporated into any product which is
sold without prior permission from the author.

When no charge is  made, this program   may be copied  and distributed
freely, provided that  this  notice  is  copied  and  distributed with
it. Each time you  redistribute the program (or  any work based on the
program),  the recipient  automatically  receives a  license  from the
original licensor  to copy or distribute the  program subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not  impose any further restrictions on
the recipients' exercise  of the rights   granted herein. You  are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

If you wish to incorporate the  program into other free programs whose
distribution conditions are different, write  to the author to ask for
permission.

If, as a  consequence of  a court judgment   or allegation  of  patent
infringement or  for any other reason (not  limited to patent issues),
conditions  are imposed on you  (whether by  court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this license, they do not
excuse   you from the  conditions   of this   license.  If you  cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
license and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not  distribute the  program  at all.   For  example, if a  patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the program by
all those who receive copies directly or  indirectly through you, then
the only way  you could satisfy  both it and  this license would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the program.

2. PhoPlayer Features
--------------------------------------------------------------

PhoPlayer is a "phoneme-to-speech" program.  PhoPlayer doesn't have a
windows interface, so it must be used in a dos prompt or with the
"run" program.

--------------------------------------------------------------
3. Command Line
--------------------------------------------------------------
As there's no interface, all the parameters of this program are passed on
the comand line.

To play one or more .pho file of the same language, the syntax of the 
command line is : phoplayer database=dbname phofile phofile ...
Example :
	phoplayer database=d:\database\en1\en1 mypho.pho mypho2.pho

To play .pho files of different languages on the same command line, the 
syntax is : phoplayer database=db1 phofile ... database=db2 phofile ... ...
Example :
	phoplayer database=d:\database\en1\en1 mypho.pho database=d:\database\fr1\fr1 monpho.pho

To change the current directory on the command line, the syntax is :
	phoplayer dir=newdirectory phofile...

To create an output file instead of playing on the sound board, use the
/T= (or /OUT= or /OUTPUT= ) flag, followed by a file name.  It creates a raw file.

To change format of the output file, use the
/T= (or /FORMAT=) flag, followed by RAW, WAV, AU or AIFF.


To create filtered output files, use the /F= (or /FILTER=) flag, followed by A8 (alaw) or U8 (mu-law).

To get help about phoplayer, used the /H (or /HELP or /?) flag.
It will display a messagebox with informations about the command line.

--------------------------------------------------------------
4. Phs Files
--------------------------------------------------------------
As a phoplayer's command line is very long, a .phs file, including all the commands can be passed.
Example : test.phs :
	; brasilian test
	Database=j:\Mbrola\wwwdba\br1\br1
	d:\mbrola\samples\br1\teste.pho

	; french test
	d:\develop\mbrola\phoplayer\samples\testfr.phs

	; spanish test
	Database=j:\Mbrola\wwwdba\es1\es1
	d:\mbrola\samples\es1\example9.pho

And the phoplayer's command line becomes :
	phoplayer test.phs

Phs syntax :
A line of a phs file can be :
	- a comment line when it begins with a ';' sign.
	- a database specification if it begins with a "database="
	- a directory specification if it begins with "dir="
	- a pitch ratio modification if it begins with "pitch="
	- a duration ratio modification if it begins with "time="
	- a voice frenquency modification if it begins with "voice="
	- a volume ratio modification if it begins with "vol="
	- the disabling or enabling of the noerror mode if it begins with "noerror=".
	  To enable the noerror mode, set noerror=yes (or true), to disable it just
	  set noerror=no (or false).
	- a .pho file to be played.
	- another .phs file to be played.	

--------------------------------------------------------------
5. Whats new
--------------------------------------------------------------
- use of the dll mbrplay.dll v2.0
- the vol= command
- the noerror=yes/no command

--------------------------------------------------------------
6. Program Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------
PhoPlayer needs 3 files to run :
	- mbrola.dll
	- mbrplay.dll
	- TctsAudio.dll

1. Copyrights & Disclaimer
--------------------------------------------------------------

This program is being provided to "you", the licensee,  by the Faculté
Polytechnique  de  Mons,  the  "author",  under the following license,
which applies to any program, object code or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright  holder  saying it may be distributed
under the terms  of this license.  The "program", below, refers to any
such program, object code or work.

By  obtaining, using and/or  copying this program,  you agree that you
have   read, understood,   and   will  comply  with these   terms  and
conditions:

Terms and conditions for the distribution of the program
--------------------------------------------------------

This program may not be sold or incorporated into any product which is
sold without prior permission from the author.

When no charge is  made, this program   may be copied  and distributed
freely, provided that  this  notice  is  copied  and  distributed with
it. Each time you  redistribute the program (or  any work based on the
program),  the recipient  automatically  receives a  license  from the
original licensor  to copy or distribute the  program subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not  impose any further restrictions on
the recipients' exercise  of the rights   granted herein. You  are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

If you wish to incorporate the  program into other free programs whose
distribution conditions are different, write  to the author to ask for
permission.

If, as a  consequence of  a court judgment   or allegation  of  patent
infringement or  for any other reason (not  limited to patent issues),
conditions  are imposed on you  (whether by  court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this license, they do not
excuse   you from the  conditions   of this   license.  If you  cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
license and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not  distribute the  program  at all.   For  example, if a  patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the program by
all those who receive copies directly or  indirectly through you, then
the only way  you could satisfy  both it and  this license would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the program.

Terms and conditions on the use of the program

Permission is granted    to use  this  software for    non-commercial,
non-military  purposes, with and only    with the voice and   language
